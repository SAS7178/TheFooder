# TheFooder

In this project I, Stephen Smith, initiated through Nashville Software School this application for my Full-Stack Capestone. 

The goal, in this application build was to provide an individual with easy convenient tools to create/find and save recipes, aswell as the instruct
ions/ingredients and image/video to view personalized page with created and saved recipes based on their unique to them. 

This project was my first solo sprint full-stack application using Javascript(React) on front-end and C#/SQL Database on back-end, where I created 
both UI/Database and styling...I also implemented fetched' remote API data, in addition to creating my own local database-API which is included in this repo.
